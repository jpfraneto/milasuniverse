This project is going to be the place where I set up the digital toys that I will use in the first months of the life of my daughter. 

It is important for her to:

* Listen to cool tales and stories so that she can start recognizing what language and imagination is about.
* Listen to amazing music that can help her root into this reality.
* Watch faces from people from all over the world, so that she can recognize what being human is.


I'll do my best.
